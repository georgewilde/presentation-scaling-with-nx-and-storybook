                                that time, different engineers have come and
                                gone and contributed to our codebase.

                            <li>
                                We've added new features and products and piled
                                code on top of code without much consideration
                                of governance and the future maintainability.

                                We were a startup. We needed to get a product
                                out the door and prove we had a product that
                                people wanted.

                                So now we’re a scale-up and we’re struggling. We
                                can continue to deliver at speed, but only if we
                                cut corners but the user and developer
                                experience is going to get worse each time we
                                do.

                        <p>
                            It also gives us a nice CLI that wraps around
                            everything and provides a consistent toolkit of
                            commands we can use to build, test and lint whatever
                            we want.

                            We spent a year using Yarn workspaces with Lerna and
                            with those tools, when you make a change, you
                            publish a new version that can then be consumed.
                            This leads to fragmentation as older applications
                            are not updated to use the latest versions and
                            you’re left supporting multiple versions of a
                            package. With Nx’s approach, when you change a
                            shared library you are forced to ensure it works
                            everywhere right there and then, you cannot leave
                            something on an older version and deal with it
                            later.

                            Once we could see how our applications would sit
                            next to each other and how we could utilise
                            libraries, we realised there would be a lot of power
                            in moving all our React components that could be
                            used in more than one application into a library and

                            guide we could to use to build, test and make

                            we’ve built 3 new applications and are moving 1

                            Although the majority of our code is still outside

                            to some significant improvements for us.
